# Blender

## Units

Select the `scene` tab in the RHS group.
Units can be found under this.

## Hotkey

Say you moved the 3d cursor by mistake. 
Now you want to move it back to the world origin.

Select the cursor control in the LHS tool bar, do `Shift+S` then select `Cursor to World Origin` then select a different control so you don't go moving the cursor again.

## Transform

Press RH mouse button before releasing the LH in order to undo move/scale/rotate.

### 3D Cursor position
To position things exactly, press `n`, which will pop out a menu from the RHS.
The popout has 3 tabs. 
If you select `view` tab, you will see a 3d cursor, from which you can rotate the position of the cursor exactly.

### Object position

Similar to the [3D Cursor position], you can press `n` then select the `item` tab.
This allows you to exactly position the selected object.

In edit mode, after selecting a vertex, you can use this menu to position the vertex exactly.
