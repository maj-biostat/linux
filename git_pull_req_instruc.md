## Git squashing commits (especially for forked repositories)

The mantra seems to be not to push until you are happy. Well, I pushed. The following will squash all the commits but is considered somewhat bad form.

Imagine you have pushed to your repository with a whole bunch of inconsequential commits. Bummer. Here is a way to get rid of them, but be very careful.

```
git clone https://github.com/maj-tki/automatic_test.git
```

The first utility CLI command you need is:

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --decorate -30 --all --date-order --date=format:'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' --pretty=format:'%C(cyan)%h%Creset %C(black bold)%ad%Creset%C(auto)%d %s' --graph"
```

Now issue the alias:

```
git lg
```

to get 

```

```

(but with colour).

Nb. Other history commands can be found here:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7853332/how-to-change-git-log-date-formats

You can squash all these into one commit by doing:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~13
```

where the 13 is one less than the total number of commits of 14. Typically we wouldn't want to get rid of all the commits. We would just get rid of the irrelevant ones. Anyway.

Aside - you could also do `git rebase -i 59caa08`

An interactive panel will open up and you basically just replace `pick` with `squash` for the 13 commit points that you want to combine into one. If nothing goes wrong you will get something like:

```
C:\Users\mjones\Documents\automatic_test>git rebase -i HEAD~13

```

but:

```
git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 13 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

so (scarily):

```
git push -f
```

resulting in:

```
git lg
* e3ea213 2019-07-17 14:47:18 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Code review changes and comments.
* 59caa08 2019-07-17 14:46:23 Init
```

As I said, in this example all of the commits were removed but typically you would just want to do this for a few.


## Git - Merging pull requests from forks

The other way around -- you are on the receiving end of a pull request.

Scenario: You have had a pull request for some new feature from a forked version of your repository. However, since the time of the fork, you have made some changes to your master and therefore there may be some merge conflicts that you want to assess piece by piece.

Assuming we added the alias (see above) do:

```
git lg
```
 to get (but with colour):

```

Now.


`cd` to the local repository folder, check the current remote repo:

```
cd linux
git remote -v
```

The above should report the current remote repository, e.g. 

```
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (push)
```

To add a new repository do something along the lines of:

```
git remote add ts https://github.com/t-student/linux.git
```

Now you should have the following remotes:

```
git remote â€“v
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (push)
ts      https://github.com/t-student/linux.git (fetch)
ts      https://github.com/t-student/linux.git (push)
```
However, you have not yet got access to the alt codebase. Do a fetch and then checkout the pull request. Following on from the example commands above, you would do something along the lines of:

```
git fetch ts
```

which gives:

```
remote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 7), reused 9 (delta 5), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
From https://github.com/t-student/linux
 * [new branch]      master     -> ts/master
```

now checkout the branch

```
git checkout -b test2 ts/master
Switched to a new branch 'test2'
Branch 'test2' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'ts'.
```

```
git status
On branch test2
Your branch is up to date with 'ts/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

so now the files that we are looking at are from the pull request.

```
head README.md
This is just some change to make sure I am out of whack with the pull request from james.


# Manjaro

banan jit wrebbly.


more commitment damn you
```

```
# Vim

# hi, i had forgotten about you

another change

## Visual Mode, Block select

http://vimcasts.org/transcripts/22/en/
```

we can get back to the HEAD of my master with:

```
git checkout master
head README.md
This is just some change to make sure I am out of whack with the pull request from james.


# Manjaro

ban

changes like this
```

```
# Vim

## Visual Mode, Block select

http://vimcasts.org/transcripts/22/en/
```

and back to ts with

```
git checkout test2
Switched to branch 'test2'
Your branch is up to date with 'ts/master'.
```

to diff between two branches first set up an external difftool like winmerge with:

```
git config diff.tool winmerge
```

then you can diff between two branches with:

```
git difftool master test2
```
which will give you a visual diff between each file.

Alternatively, just show the files that have differences:

```
git diff --name-only master test2
```

which shows 

```
README.md
install_R_pkgs.R
vim.md
```

Anyway to merge (properly) do:

```
git checkout master
git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

now merge:

```
git merge --no-ff test2
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Ok, we got a merge conflict. Good, nice to know git notices. If we do:

```
git status
```

we get:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:

        modified:   install_R_pkgs.R
        modified:   vim.md

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   README.md
```

So now we can review all the changes, accept those that we care about and fix any conflicts. Conflicts are marked by <<<<<<<, for example, looking in README.md I see:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ban

changes like this
=======
banan jit wrebbly.


more commitment damn you
>>>>>>> test2
```
which is the bit we need to fix up. For the other files (that merged with no conflicts) all we need to do is review the changes then commit and push.

Finally, you can delete a local branch and remove remotes with:

```
git branch -d test2
Deleted branch test2 (was c3aa2e0).
```

```
git remote rm ts
```

then `git remote -v` should only return:

```
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/maj-tki/linux.git (push)
```
